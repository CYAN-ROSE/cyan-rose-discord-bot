# Cyan Rose Discord Moderation and User Tooling

This is the tooling suite for Cyan Rose which acts as a tool set for users and 
moderation alike. 

We are using the following libraries:
- [`discord.py`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/)
- [`peewee`](http://http://docs.peewee-orm.com/)

We are using the discord.py libary as the default way to interact with the
Discord API. We prefer this over other libs as it is maintained and reasonably
easy to use in most regards.
